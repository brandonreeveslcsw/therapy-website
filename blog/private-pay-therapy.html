  <h1>Why I Don't Accept Insurance (and What That Means for You)</h1>

<div class="container page-content">

<p>One of the first questions people ask when they're looking for a therapist is, "Do you take my insurance?" When the answer is no, it can feel like a door closing. I understand that. But I want to explain why I've chosen to work on a private pay basis — and why, for many people, it's actually a better arrangement than it might seem at first.</p>

<h2>What Private Pay Means</h2>

<p>Private pay simply means you pay for your sessions directly rather than going through an insurance company. There's no middleman between you and your care. You pay a set fee, and that's it.</p>

<p>It's straightforward, and it keeps things between us — which, as I'll explain, matters more than you might think.</p>

<h2>Your Privacy Is Fully Protected</h2>

<p>When a therapist bills insurance, they're required to submit a mental health diagnosis to the insurance company. That diagnosis goes into your medical record. It can potentially be accessed during life insurance applications, security clearance processes, and certain employment screenings. For some people, that doesn't matter. For others — especially professionals, first responders, or anyone concerned about how a diagnosis might follow them — it matters a great deal.</p>

<p>With private pay, no diagnosis is reported to anyone unless you want it to be. What happens in therapy stays in therapy. Full stop.</p>

<h2>Clinical Freedom</h2>

<p>Insurance companies don't just pay for therapy — they have opinions about it. They may limit the number of sessions you're approved for. They may require specific types of treatment. They may decide that your issue doesn't meet their criteria for "medical necessity," cutting off coverage before you and your therapist agree you're ready.</p>

<p>When I work outside of insurance, I have complete clinical freedom. I can tailor treatment to what you actually need rather than what an insurance reviewer thinks you need based on a diagnostic code. We can go at your pace. We can work on what matters to you, even if it doesn't fit neatly into a pre-approved treatment box.</p>

<p>That freedom is something I take seriously. After 25 years of doing this work, I've seen what happens when treatment decisions are driven by insurance logistics instead of clinical judgment. It's not ideal for anyone — least of all the client.</p>

<h2>Session Flexibility</h2>

<p>Insurance-based therapy often means strict session lengths — typically 45 to 50 minutes, no exceptions. Without insurance constraints, there's more flexibility in how we structure sessions. If something important comes up at the 45-minute mark, we're not racing to wrap up because of billing codes.</p>

<h2>You May Still Get Reimbursed</h2>

<p>Here's the part most people don't know: even though I don't bill insurance directly, many insurance plans offer out-of-network benefits. That means you can submit a claim after your session and get a portion of the cost reimbursed.</p>

<p>I provide what's called a <strong>superbill</strong> — a detailed receipt with all the information your insurance company needs to process an out-of-network claim. You submit it, and depending on your plan, you may get back a significant percentage of what you paid.</p>

<p>It's worth checking your plan's out-of-network benefits. Many people are surprised by how much coverage they actually have. If you're not sure how to check, I'm happy to walk you through it. You can also find more details on my <a href="../faq.html">FAQ page</a>.</p>

<h2>An Investment in Yourself</h2>

<p>I know that paying out of pocket for therapy is a real financial consideration. I don't take that lightly. But I've also seen, over and over again, that the people who invest directly in their therapy tend to be more engaged in the process. There's something about making a deliberate choice — saying, "This is worth my time and my money" — that shifts how you approach the work.</p>

<p>Therapy isn't a luxury. It's a practical tool for dealing with real problems. And like most things in life, the quality of what you get is connected to the thoughtfulness of the arrangement.</p>

<h2>What This Looks Like in Practice</h2>

<p>When you work with me, you'll know exactly what each session costs. No surprise bills, no denied claims, no waiting to find out if your next session is "approved." You book when you want, we work on what you need, and the relationship stays between us.</p>

<p>If you have questions about fees, insurance reimbursement, or how any of this works, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to talk it through — no obligation, no pressure.
