    {"@type":"Question","name":"What should I expect in a first session?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"The first session is about getting to know each other. I'll ask about what brought you in, what's going on in your life, and what you're hoping to get out of therapy. There's no pressure to share more than you're comfortable with. By the end, we'll have a sense of whether we're a good fit and a general direction for moving forward."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How long does therapy take?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"It depends on what you're working on. Some people benefit from a few months of focused work. Others find value in longer-term therapy. There's no set number of sessions — we'll check in regularly and make sure the work still makes sense for you."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How often will we meet?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Most clients start with weekly sessions. As things improve, we may move to every other week or as needed. We'll figure out what works best for your situation."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Do I need to have a specific problem to start therapy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. You don't need a diagnosis, a crisis, or a clear label for what's going on. Many people start therapy because something feels off — even if they can't put their finger on exactly what it is. That's a perfectly good reason to begin."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What's the difference between a therapist, psychologist, and psychiatrist?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"A therapist (like an LCSW) provides talk therapy and counseling. A psychologist typically holds a doctoral degree and may also provide therapy and psychological testing. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who can prescribe medication. These roles often work together — I'm happy to coordinate with other providers when it's helpful."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you accept insurance?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. This is a private pay practice. I do not accept insurance, which allows for greater flexibility, privacy, and clinical focus. That said, I'm happy to provide a superbill that you can submit to your insurance company to use any out-of-network benefits you may have."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What are your rates?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"I'm happy to discuss fees during an initial consultation. Feel free to call or use the online booking link to get started."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you offer telehealth?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Yes. I offer secure telehealth sessions for anyone located in the state of Louisiana, in addition to in-person sessions at my Baton Rouge office."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Where is your office?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"My office is located at Baton Rouge Counseling Associates, 10935 Perkins Rd, Baton Rouge, LA."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What is your cancellation policy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"I ask for at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule. This allows me to offer that time to someone else who may need it. Late cancellations or missed sessions may be subject to a fee."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"How do I schedule an appointment?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"You can schedule online through my booking page or call me directly at 225.267.7431. If you're not sure whether therapy is right for you, you're welcome to reach out with questions first."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What are your credentials?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"I am a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW) and a Board Approved Clinical Supervisor (BACS) with over 25 years of clinical experience. I also serve on the Louisiana State Board of Social Work Examiners."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"What is your approach to therapy?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"My approach is practical, direct, and tailored to the individual. I draw from a range of evidence-based methods and adjust based on what works best for you. The goal is real, tangible progress — not therapy for the sake of therapy."}},
    {"@type":"Question","name":"Do you prescribe medication?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. As a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, I do not prescribe medication. However, if medication might be helpful, I'm happy to coordinate with a psychiatrist or your primary care provider to make sure you're getting well-rounded support."}}
