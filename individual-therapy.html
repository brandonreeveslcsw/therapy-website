  <h1>Individual Therapy</h1>
  <p>Thoughtful, grounded support for adults and young adults in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.</p>
</section>

<section class="page-content section">
<div class="container">
  <p>I offer individual therapy for adults and young adults who are looking for thoughtful, grounded support during times of stress, transition, or uncertainty. My work is collaborative, paced, and focused on meaningful change — without pressure to move faster than feels right.</p>

  <h2>What Brings People to Therapy</h2>
  <p>People come to therapy because something isn't working the way it should. Sometimes there's a clear issue — anxiety that won't let up, a loss you can't move past, a relationship pattern that keeps repeating. Other times, there's no single problem — just a sense that something needs to change.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anxiety and persistent worry</li>
    <li>Depression and low motivation</li>
    <li>Trauma and unresolved past experiences</li>
    <li>Life transitions — career, relationships, identity</li>
    <li>Burnout and chronic stress</li>
    <li>Difficulty with emotions or relationships</li>
    <li>A general feeling of being stuck or off balance</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How I Work</h2>
  <p>My approach is depth-oriented and practical. We'll work to understand the patterns that shape how you think, feel, and relate — while staying grounded in real-world change. I use a variety of therapeutic approaches, including EMDR when appropriate, and tailor every aspect of treatment to the individual.</p>
  <p>Therapy isn't something that someone does to you. It's something the therapist does with you.</p>

  <h2>Trauma-Informed Therapy</h2>
  <p>Past experiences can continue to shape thoughts, emotions, and reactions long after the events themselves have passed. I use trauma-informed approaches, including EMDR when appropriate, to help clients process unresolved experiences in a way that is paced, collaborative, and grounded.</p>

  <h2>In-Person &amp; Telehealth</h2>
  <p>While most of my practice involves in-person sessions at my Baton Rouge office, I offer secure telehealth sessions for clients located anywhere in Louisiana. Both formats allow for the same depth and quality of work.</p>

  <blockquote>This is a private pay practice. I do not accept insurance. This allows for greater flexibility, privacy, and clinical focus.</blockquote>
