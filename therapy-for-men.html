  <h1>Therapy for Men</h1>
  <p>Practical, direct, and grounded — a different kind of therapy for men in Baton Rouge.</p>
</section>

<section class="page-content section">
<div class="container">
  <p>Many men come to therapy without a clear label for what's wrong. Stress may have built up, motivation may be slipping, or something simply feels off despite things looking fine on the surface.</p>
  <p>Therapy can provide a space to slow things down, gain clarity, and move forward with greater steadiness.</p>

  <h2>A Practical, Direct Approach</h2>
  <p>My approach is practical, thoughtful, and direct. Therapy isn't about overanalyzing or being pushed into emotional territory before you're ready. We focus on understanding patterns, increasing awareness, and making changes that carry over into everyday life.</p>
  <p>This isn't talk therapy for the sake of talking. It's structured, purposeful work — at a pace that makes sense for you.</p>

  <h2>Common Reasons Men Seek Therapy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stress, burnout, and anxiety</strong> — when the weight of responsibilities becomes harder to manage</li>
    <li><strong>Anger and irritability</strong> — reacting in ways that don't match who you want to be</li>
    <li><strong>Relationship difficulties</strong> — communication breakdowns, distance, repeated patterns</li>
    <li><strong>Identity, direction, and purpose</strong> — feeling uncertain about where you're headed</li>
    <li><strong>Difficulty understanding or expressing emotions</strong> — knowing something is off but not having language for it</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>You don't need to have a clear goal to begin.</blockquote>

  <h2>What to Expect</h2>
  <p>Sessions are straightforward. We'll identify what's going on, understand the patterns underneath it, and work on practical strategies that make a real difference in your day-to-day life. There's no script, no jargon, and no pressure to be someone you're not in the room.</p>
  <p>I've worked with men for over 25 years. I understand the specific pressures, expectations, and barriers that men face when it comes to asking for help — and I've built my practice around making that process as straightforward and productive as possible.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do I need a specific problem to start therapy?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer"><p>No. Many men come to therapy without a clear label for what's wrong. You don't need a diagnosis or a crisis — just a sense that something could be better.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What is a session actually like?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer"><p>Conversational, focused, and practical. We'll talk about what's going on in your life, identify patterns, and work on concrete strategies. It's not lying on a couch while someone takes notes.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you accept insurance?</h3>
    <div class="faq-answer"><p>No. This is a private pay practice. This allows for greater flexibility, privacy, and a focus on what's best for you clinically — not what an insurance company approves. That said, I'm happy to provide a superbill that you can submit to your insurance company if you'd like to use any out-of-network benefits you may have.</p></div>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do you offer telehealth?</h3>
